Both gvim and 16-color terminals are supported.

Description
-----------

This is a light color scheme for vim with mild contrast and not so many colors. 
16-color terminals are also supported by mapping colors in your terminal 
emulator settings. It is good for prolonged coding.

Installation
------------

Copy the file to your vim colors directory and then do :color cake16.

If you are only using gvim, there's no more work. If you are using vim in 
terminals, open your terminal settings and map each color to the following 
table:

UNIX color code            color hex value
ANSI 0  (normal black)     #774f38
ANSI 1  (normal red)       #b95942
ANSI 2  (normal green)     #308444
ANSI 3  (normal yellow)    #c79747
ANSI 4  (normal blue)      #678797
ANSI 5  (normal magenta)   #878787
ANSI 6  (normal cyan)      #308090
ANSI 7  (normal white)     #ede4d4
ANSI 8  (bright black)     #774f38
ANSI 9  (bright red)       #f10000
ANSI 10 (bright green)     #8fb1c0
ANSI 11 (bright yellow)    #e4dccc
ANSI 12 (bright blue)      #aaccdc
ANSI 13 (bright magenta)   #afafaf
ANSI 14 (bright cyan)      #6cb7c7
ANSI 15 (bright white)     #f7efdf

If you are using iTerm2, you don't have to do this manually, just import colors 
from iterm2/cacke16.itermcolors.
