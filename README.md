16-color terminals are also supported by mapping colors in your terminal 
emulator settings. It is good for prolonged coding.

Installation
------------

Copy the file to your vim colors directory and then do :color cake16.

If you are only using gvim, there's no more work. If you are using vim in 
terminals, open your terminal settings and map each color to the following 
table:

UNIX color code            color hex value
ANSI 0  (normal black)     #774f38
ANSI 1  (normal red)       #b95942
ANSI 2  (normal green)     #308444
ANSI 3  (normal yellow)    #b58839
ANSI 4  (normal blue)      #50707e
ANSI 5  (normal magenta)   #878787
ANSI 6  (normal cyan)      #308090
ANSI 7  (normal white)     #ede4d4
ANSI 8  (bright black)     #878787
ANSI 9  (bright red)       #f10000
ANSI 10 (bright green)     #82a3b3
ANSI 11 (bright yellow)    #c79747
ANSI 12 (bright blue)      #678797
ANSI 13 (bright magenta)   #aa56b2
ANSI 14 (bright cyan)      #e4dccc
ANSI 15 (bright white)     #f7efdf

If you are using iTerm2, you don't have to do this manually, just import colors 
from iterm2/cacke16.itermcolors.
